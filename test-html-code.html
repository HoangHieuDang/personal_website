    <h3><b>Story Time</b></h3>
    <p>I was born and raised in Vietnam. After completing high school, I decided to pursue my studies abroad in Germany
        in 2012. Over the years of living, studying, and building relationships with the people there, I grew deeply
        connected to the culture. This led me to embrace my new home fully, and in 2024, I became a German citizen.</p>

    <p>As a curious individual, I never want to limit my abilities. This drive fuels my passion for exploring and
        creating in diverse fields like music, art, engineering, and programming. Iâ€™m a creative person who thrives on
        blending the expressive nature of music and art with the analytical problem-solving of engineering and
        programming.</p>

    <p>Throughout my studies and career, my love for music and art has remained a constant source of inspiration. My
        ultimate goal is to merge art and engineering to create something truly unique, while continuing to develop my
        distinctive skill sets and passions to their fullest potential.</p>

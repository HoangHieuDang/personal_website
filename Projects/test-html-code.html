                    controller in any DAW, such as Ableton Live. By mapping finger bends to MIDI parameters, users can control synthesizers, effects, and automation in real time through intuitive gestures — making the glove a tactile, expressive performance
                    tool that bridges human motion and digital sound. This project combines sensor-based hardware prototyping, embedded programming, and MIDI protocol implementation, with the goal of exploring new ways of interacting with music production

                    <li class="description-li">A fully functional testing software tailored to SALT’s hardware logic</li>
                    <li class="description-li">A custom-built Prüfadaptersystem (Test Adapter Typ 127) integrating mechanical and electrical interfaces (using KiCAD and Eagle Fusion 360)</li>

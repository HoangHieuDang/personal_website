                <p class="description-paragraph">The MIDI Glove is a wearable music interface I developed using Dehnungsmessstreifen (strain gauges) and an Arduino microcontroller. It translates hand and finger movements into MIDI signals, allowing the glove to act as a generic MIDI
                    controller in any DAW, such as Ableton Live. By mapping finger bends to MIDI parameters, users can control synthesizers, effects, and automation in real time through intuitive gestures — making the glove a tactile, expressive performance
                    tool that bridges human motion and digital sound. This project combines sensor-based hardware prototyping, embedded programming, and MIDI protocol implementation, with the goal of exploring new ways of interacting with music production
                    environments.

                    <li class="description-li">A fully functional testing software tailored to SALT’s hardware logic</li>

            <p class="description-paragraph">I’ve been performing as DJ Kamikatzi since 2017, when I first joined the Korean Party Factory – one of Europe’s most exciting K-pop and K-hip-hop event collectives. </p>
            <p class="description-paragraph">What started as a one-time gig quickly turned into something bigger:</p>
            <p class="description-paragraph">I became their resident DJ, and since then, I’ve been touring regularly across Germany and shaping the musical identity of the shows we create. My sets are rooted in K-pop, hip-hop, and electronic music, but I love weaving in experimental
                edits and high-energy transitions that keep the dancefloor alive and connected. I’m not just mixing songs – I’m building an emotional and rhythmic experience that reflects the energy of the crowd. </p>
            <p class="description-paragraph">Over the years, I’ve also had the chance to perform outside of Germany, and now I’m expanding more regularly across Europe, connecting with new audiences and growing the Kamikatzi sound.</p>

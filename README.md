# Description
- The purpose of this project is to develop a personal website to demonstrate my skills in applying vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
- This project reflects my current understanding and abilities at the time of its creation. It was intentionally built without any frameworks to compel me to delve deeper into the fundamental principles and core elements of web development.
- All visual elements and UI components were created and implemented from scratch using only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project also served as a valuable learning experience, highlighting the importance of using frameworks like React and Angular by exposing the challenges of building a website without them.
